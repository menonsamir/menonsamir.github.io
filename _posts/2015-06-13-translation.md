# Translation


I started reading the logs, and I was amazed.

I found people wishing happy holidays, sending inspirational quotes, comforting their friends, doing math homework, writing love letters, learning swear words, and more. The longest piece of text was a poorly written original poem, and the most translated word (that I can write here) was 'trigonometry'.

My translation app had taken off over the past two weeks. It let people in India translate text over SMS (texting), since so many of them didn't have smartphones. It was very simple, but was apparently very useful - over 10,000 people had already used it!

The whole thing started with an innocuous email from my mom. After reading an article, she mentioned how apps that work over texting were becoming very popular in developing nations like India and China. She wondered aloud what kinds of apps they would want.

This was par for the course for my mom and I. We've always imagined creating products that would make our lives easier; everything from better salad tongs to an app to schedule orthodontist appointments.

My mom tried to suggest a weather app, but I came up with one that was even better - translation. India has many regional languages, and not knowing English can block many opportunities in employment and education. Translation could make a big difference in people's lives.

The app would be very simple - you would text "What's your name? hindi", and it would respond with "Apka nam kya hai?". I built the whole thing in a weekend, mostly to test my programming skills. When it was done, I was proud.

Looking back, it is one of the worst pieces of software I've ever written. It was filled with helpful error messages like "Error 403 - Forbidden Access", prone to crashing, and held together with the digital equivalent of duct tape and chewing gum. It was almost impossible to edit one part of the code without breaking some other part; what programmers fondly call "spaghetti code".

Somehow, it was still useful. In the first week, I had over 200 users. I was overjoyed, and when I told my mom, she asked me, "What are people translating with the app?". I had actually never considered the question, and it seemed pretty important, so I put in a small feature that would keep logs of what people translated.

Over the next week, the app was featured as a 'Recommended App', and the number of users quickly climbed to 10,000. But as I read the logs, those 10,000 users became so much more than a number. Each of those people needed to translate something, and my app helped them. From my laptop over a weekend in upstate New York, I had helped someone finish their math homework in Delhi, and helped someone else write letters to their relatives in Dubai. My little app broke down barriers across continents, generations, and economic class.

This is what I love to do. Computer Science is fascinating, but the true joy of computing is not in computers, but in people. I can create something and have people all around the world use it within days, changing lives with the click-clack of my keyboard and my imagination.
